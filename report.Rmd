# Objectives

<p>
This report was created for <b>Practical Machine Learning Course</b> project of the Johns Hopkins University (Bloomberg School of Public Health) Data Science Specialization on Coursera.org, and it aims to present all steps taken to predict in which way a series of execise were performed by subjects - data and definition used herein can be found at <b>Human Activity Recognition</b> web page (<a href="http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har">here</a>).
</p>

<p>
To facilitate the understanding and reproducibility, all files were copied to <a href="https://github.com/ceacunha/PMLProject">this</a> <i>GitHub</i> repository. In the repo, one will find:
</p>

- <b>data directory</b>: used to archive data files used for training (originaly from <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv">here</a>) and test (originaly from <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv">here</a>) of machine learning algorithms;

- <b>output directory</b>: used to archive resulting files from prediction process;

- <b>project_script.R</b>: original and complete R programming language script;

- <b>report.Rmd</b>: R markdown file from which this report is created; 

- <b>report.html</b>: this report.
